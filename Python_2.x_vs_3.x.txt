Q : What is the difference between python 2.x and 3.x ?
Ans: 1) Division operator
print 7 / 5
print -7 / 5    
Output in Python 2.x 
1 
-2 
Output in Python 3.x : 
1.4 
-1.4 
2) print function
print 'Hello, Geeks'      # Python 3.x doesn't support 
print('Hope You like these facts') 
3) Unicode
print(type('default string ')) 
print(type(b'string with b ')) 
Output in Python 2.x (Bytes is same as str) 
<type 'str'> 
<type 'str'>   
Output in Python 3.x (Bytes and str are different) 
<class 'str'> 
<class 'bytes'> 
4)xrange
In Python 3.x, the range function now does what xrange does in Python 2.x,
so to keep our code portable, we might want to stick to using range instead. 
So Python 3.xâ€™s range function is xrange from Python 2.x.
5)Error Handling
Python 2.x : 
try: 
    trying_to_check_error 
except NameError, err: 
    print err, 'Error Caused'
python 3.x: 
try: 
     trying_to_check_error 
except NameError as err: # 'as' is needed in Python 3.x 
     print (err, 'Error Caused')
