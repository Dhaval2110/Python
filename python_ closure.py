Advantages :
With Python closure, we donâ€™t need to use global values. This is because they let us refer to nonlocal variables. A closure then provides some form of data hiding.
When we have only a few Python methods (usually, only one), we may use a Python3 closure instead of implementing a class for that. This makes it easier on the programmer.
A closure, lets us implement a Python decorator.
A closure lets us invoke Python function outside its scope.
